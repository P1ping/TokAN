# TokAN: Accent Normalization Using Self-Supervised Discrete Tokens

**Code coming soon!** We will release the implementation of our Interspeech 2025 paper "Accent Normalization Using Self-Supervised Discrete Tokens with Non-Parallel Data" by August 2025.

## Abstract
Accent normalization converts foreign-accented speech into native-like speech while preserving speaker identity. We propose a novel pipeline using self-supervised discrete tokens and non-parallel training data. The system extracts tokens from source speech, converts them through a dedicated model, and synthesizes the output using flow matching. Our method demonstrates superior performance over a frame-to-frame baseline in naturalness, accentedness reduction, and timbre preservation across multiple English accents. Through token-level phonetic analysis, we validate the effectiveness of our token-based approach. We also develop two duration preservation methods, suitable for applications such as dubbing.
